It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal ""SKL"" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions."

THALIANA OXIDATIVE STRESS-RELATED ABC1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (ATOSA1),ABC1K8 is a member of an atypical protein kinase family that is induced by heavy metals. Loss of function mutations affect the metabolic profile of chloroplast lipids. It appears to function along with ABC1K7 in mediating lipid membrane changes in response to stress. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
